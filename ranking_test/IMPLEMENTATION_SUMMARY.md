# Ranking Test Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

A complete standalone test program in `ranking_test/` that demonstrates encrypted ranking of cosine similarities using OpenFHE CKKS.

## Key Components

### 1. ranking_test.cpp (322 lines)
The main test program that:
- Generates and normalizes 10 storage 3D vectors and 1 query vector
- Computes plaintext cosine similarities
- Sets up CKKS crypto context with appropriate parameters
- Encrypts the similarity vector
- Uses `rankWithCorrection()` to rank encrypted similarities
- Decrypts and compares results with plaintext
- Provides detailed output showing all comparisons

**Features:**
- Uses `rankWithCorrection()` for accurate ranking with tie handling
- Configurable parameters (comparison depth, precision, etc.)
- Detailed error analysis per vector
- Clear comparison output showing if plaintext and encrypted agree

### 2. CMakeLists.txt (42 lines)
Build configuration that:
- Finds OpenFHE from `../dependencies/openfhe-development/build`
- Includes all necessary openfhe-statistics source files
- Sets up proper include directories
- Links against OpenFHE libraries
- Creates the `ranking_test` executable

### 3. build_test.sh (51 lines)
Automated build script that:
- Creates build directory
- Runs CMake and Make
- Executes the test automatically
- Provides clear success/failure feedback

### 4. README.md
Complete documentation including:
- Overview of the test
- Build instructions
- Expected output
- Dependencies and requirements

## Technical Details

### Parameters Used
- **Vector length**: 10 (number of similarity values)
- **Comparison depth**: 13 (depth for polynomial approximations)
- **Multiplicative depth**: 17 (compareDepth + 4 for rankWithCorrection)
- **Decimal precision**: 35 bits (high precision for accuracy)
- **Comparison bounds**: [-1.0, 1.0] (cosine similarity range)

### Ranking Algorithm
The test uses `rankWithCorrection()` from the ranking module which:
- Handles ties more accurately than basic ranking
- Uses polynomial approximations for comparisons
- Corrects for equality cases (when similarities are very close)

### Output Structure
The test produces 7 main sections:
1. Vector generation and normalization
2. Plaintext cosine similarity computation
3. CKKS encryption setup
4. Similarity encryption
5. Encrypted ranking using rankWithCorrection
6. Decryption and comparison
7. Final comparison with error analysis

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Isolated Directory**: The test is completely separate from the main codebase for independence
2. **Fixed Seeds**: Uses deterministic random seeds (42, 123) for reproducibility
3. **High Precision**: Uses 35-bit decimal precision for accurate results
4. **Detailed Output**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis
5. **Error Analysis**: Per-vector error reporting plus overall statistics

## How to Use

Simply run from the `ranking_test/` directory:
```bash
./build_test.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
./ranking_test
```

## Expected Results

The test should:
1. Successfully generate and normalize all vectors
2. Compute cosine similarities correctly
3. Encrypt and decrypt with minimal error
4. Rank encrypted similarities accurately
5. Identify the same maximum vector in both plaintext and encrypted cases
6. Show low error rates (< 0.001 typically)
